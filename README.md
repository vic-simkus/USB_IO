# YAUBOB
Six output yet another USB-based output board (YAUBOB)

This is yet another reinvention of the wheel.  This wheel is just as round as any other wheel.  The only difference between this and other such wheels is that this one is mine.  

It's licensed in such a way as to encourage reuse in hopes that some sort of standard develops.  I dream of a world where the hoarde of USB IO boards on EBay speak one language.

I chose to base this around an Arduino becasue I get USB stack, processor, software libraries etc etc.
